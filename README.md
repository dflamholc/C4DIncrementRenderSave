-- IncrementRenderSaveRgn_v1.1 


DESCRIPTIOIN & INTENDED USE
A script for Cinema 4D that will save the current doc and render it in the Picture Viewer or preparing for a Region Render. After render starts the doc will be closed, and a clone of the document will be incremented and made ready for edit.

This way the current render file-name in the picture viewer will correspond to recenlty saved file.

The idea of this script is to facilitate render tests, where its easy to backtrack to a previous image stored in the Picture Viewer, as there will be a c4d document saved with that exact name.

TODO LIST:
[] Create subfolder to saved docs as the amount increments can grow out of comfort zone
[] Create GUI with options to keep only a defined number of copies
[] Option to delete those copies once render tests are done
